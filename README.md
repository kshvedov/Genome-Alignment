Genome Alignment

This program holds two algorithms Global Alignment (uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm of Optimal Global Alignment) and Local Alignment Both use affine gap penalty function to access the alignments.

The goal of the project is to access how similar two strings are by scoring them. The process of scoring happens through the program attempting to align two strings in a table and then retracing back to retrieve the optimal alignment. The retrace produces a visual shows where the string matches, where there are gaps and where the strings don't match.
